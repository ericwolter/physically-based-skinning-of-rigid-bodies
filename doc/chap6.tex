\begin{itemize}
\item Describing scenario
\item Two fingers try to pick up a cylinder of the floor
\item Pressure onto the cylinder results in friction and the ability to pick up the cylinder
\item Comparing traditional simple rigid body simulation with new combined body approach
\item Simulation using three simple blocks of rigid bodies
\item Simulation fails because the cylinder is pushed out of the two fingers
\item Simulation using the proposed combined bodies
\item Tissue wraps around are cylinder providing a larger contact area
\item The friction at contact area enables fingers to pick up cylinder
\end{itemize}
