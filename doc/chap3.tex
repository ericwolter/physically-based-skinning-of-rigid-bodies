\begin{itemize}
\item Some(**concrete reference missing**) focus on simulations which only aim to simulated both rigid bodies and deformable bodies in the same world. But  any body is either rigid or deformable. So the inner forces and collisions between bones and tissue are not really modeled and explored.
\item Other(**concrete reference missing**) use non realtime methods to simulated deformable bodies and are thus not applicable to the realtime simulation and problems involved when using oriented particles.
\item The state of the art thus does not provide realtime simulations of soft tissue directly attached to rigid bones.
