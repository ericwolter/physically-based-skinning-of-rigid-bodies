#Physically-based Skinning of Rigid Bodies

This is the code and document for my bachelor's thesis.
It includes my own *rough* implementation of "[Solid Simulation with Oriented Particles" by [Matthias MÃ¼ller](http://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/orientedParticles.pdf) and [Nuttapong Chentanez](http://www.chentanez.info/)
I developed a simple method to couple their oriented particles with a rigid body simulation built on top of the [bullet](www.bulletphysics.com) physics library.

The code is provided as-is. It probably doesn't even compile anymore...
